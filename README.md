# Rose Rocket Coding Exercise

## How to Run

I completed the challenge using a React client and a (minimal) Node server.

- clone this repository: `https://github.com/epwallace/rose-rocket-challenge.git`
- start the server:
  - navigate to the root directory
  - run `npm i` to install the dependencies`
  - run `npm start`; the process will use port `4000`
- start the client:
  - navigate to the `client/` subdirectory
  - run `npm i` to install the dependencies
  - run `npm start`; the process will use port `3000`
  - visit http://localhost:3000 to use the app
